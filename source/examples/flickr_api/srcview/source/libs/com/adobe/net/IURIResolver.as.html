     * The URI class cannot know about DNS aliases, virtual hosts, or
     * symbolic links that may be involved.  The application can provide
     * an implementation of this interface to resolve the URI before the
     * URI class makes any comparisons.  For example, a web host has
     * two aliases:
     * 
     * &lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;
     *    http://www.site.com/
     *    http://www.site.net/
     * &lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
     * 
     * &lt;p&gt;The application can provide an implementation that automatically
     * resolves site.net to site.com before URI compares two URI objects.
     * Only the application can know and understand the context in which
     * the URI&apos;s are being used.&lt;/p&gt;
     * 
     * &lt;p&gt;Use the URI.resolver accessor to assign a custom resolver to
     * the URI class.  Any resolver specified is global to all instances
     * of URI.&lt;/p&gt;
     * 
     * &lt;p&gt;URI will call this before performing URI comparisons in the
     * URI.getRelation() and URI.getCommonParent() functions.
