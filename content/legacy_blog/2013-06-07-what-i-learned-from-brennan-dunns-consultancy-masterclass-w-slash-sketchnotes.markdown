title: "What I Learned From Brennan Dunn's Consultancy Masterclass"

Consulting is something that I truly love. Helping businesses succeed, helping
employees to stop focusing on mundane repeatable tasks, helping enterprises
drive large scale commerce... these are truly activities that I enjoy. Getting
into the mix, digging up core problems and providing solutions is not a bad way
to earn a living.

As a constant learner, I have a strong desire to learn from people that have
already made my future mistakes, so that I can learn from them and avoid them.
Questions like "how to I maintain a steady pipeline of work?" and "where the
heck do I find clients that I will love to work with?" are questions that seem
elusive. Obviously they are answerable, because people do this sort of thing all
the time.

Brennan started offering his [Consultancy
Masterclass](https://doubleyourfreelancingrate.com/build-a-consultancy), and from
the moment he launched, I've been extremely curious. It isn't cheap at almost
$1,200, but I had the feeling that learning from Brennan's experience in a more
direct way than his books, [Double Your Freelancing
Rate](https://doubleyourfreelancingrate.com/) and [The
Blueprint](https://doubleyourfreelancingrate.com/the-blueprint), **had** to be
beneficial. Both of the books are excellent. I encourage you to follow the links
and buy them today. When I saw that The Blueprints top-tier package included a
discount to the class, I was sold.

The class itself is over the course of two half-days. The core topics covered
were:

- Sustaining a consultancy
- Pipeline management
- Marketing and networking through events
- Vetting and acquiring high quality clients
- Cultivating lasting relationships
- Billing and cash flow
- Value based rates vs. commodity rates
- Culture (internal & external)
- Staffing
- Branding
- Operations (remote v brick & mortar)
- Handling problem clients
- <strong>Productized Consulting</strong>

It was really crammed with information.

One of my absolute favorite benefits of taking the class is the community
access. All of the consultants that have taken the class have access to the
_very_ active email list. Since taking the class, I've learned a ton from this
group of like-minded folks trying to build sustainable businesses.

Overall, this was a great experience, and I highly recommend it to anybody that
might benefit. It is a proper level++.

Brennan has given me permission to publish my notes from the class. These aren't a
replacement for actually attending, but still contain a trove of valuable
information. I've found myself, while sketchnoting Brennan's talks, drawing
stacks of money near his topics. That's what this class is about, stacking paper
and loving what you do.
