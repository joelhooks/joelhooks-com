An email list is a social network. You list is a lot like Twitter. Folks can sign up and get notified of updates. They can unsubscribe whenever they like, and resubscribe in the future.

When you start to think about your list like this, it opens a lot of possibilities, and for me anyway, removes some of the stress related swith communicating with your network.

It also relates to your blog space, which is similar in nature, and can even be a one to one correlation.

It feels like at some point folks switched to the idea that a blog post was an in depth technical tutorial with thousands of words.

Does that add pressure and complexity to the writing and sharing process that isn't needed?

Does every blog post or email to your list need to be an in-depth tutorial.

No. They don't.

If you've been thinking about starting an email list, it's something I would highly recommend. Start building your own social network. Start sharing what you learn and know.

ConvertKit ([affiliate link](https://convertkit.com?lmref=ia534A)) is my favorite provider. 

If you have a list, or if you start one, please send me the link. I'd love to subscribe.
