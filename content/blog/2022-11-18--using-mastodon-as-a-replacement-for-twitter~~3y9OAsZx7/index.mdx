After [15 years on Twitter](/15-years-of-twitter-vs-that-one-rich-asshole) recent events have me strongly considering other venues for my positive and optimistic updates to like-minded folks.

Mastodon has seen a strong boost in utility recently as a solid replacement to Twitter.

## Choosing a home server/instance

I've been on Mastodon since 2017 and it was never a great fit. I joined the largest global instance, and it just lacked a "feel" that I could get into.

This time around I joined a [tech community focused Mastodon instance](https://hachyderm.io/) and [migrated my previous account](https://blog.joinmastodon.org/2019/06/how-to-migrate-from-one-server-to-another/) to it. It was quick and painless and the more focused community was a big boost to the overall vibe.

There's loads of instances to choose from. Here's a fun little [Mastodon Instance Wizard](https://instances.social/) to help narrow it down.

## Cross-Posting

[Mastodon Twitter Cross Poster](https://crossposter.masto.donte.com.br/) works well, but I recommend digging into the options and being conscious and respectful of the ethos on the target platform. You can use a simple hashtag to filter out posts so they aren't cross-posted (I use `#tw`).

I also don't cross-post RTs and allow my replies (threads) to be cross-posted.

Note that Twitter Circles posts are NOT filtered by default and will cross-post to Mastodon if not filtered.

## iOS Client

The official Mastodon client is not my favorite but [always tasteful Alex Hillman](@alexhillman@jawns.club) suggested [MetaText](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/metatext/id1523996615) and it's been great so far. It's open source too ([github](https://github.com/metabolist/metatext)), which is very cool.

This post is a seedling, and I'll keep updating it as explorations continue.
