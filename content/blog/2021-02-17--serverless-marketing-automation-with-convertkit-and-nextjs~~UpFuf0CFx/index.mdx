Tools like [Convertkit](https://convertkit.com?lmref=ia534A) provide a lot of powerful tools you can use for marketing automation, but as a developer I want to goa layer deeper and find that using serverless functions with a framework like Next.js provides immense power to customize automation.

In [this episode of Learn with Jason](https://www.learnwithjason.dev/serverless-marketing-automation-for-react), I guide Jason through subscribing somebody to his email list, setting a cookie with their Convertkit ID, and then using that ID to load the subscriber from Convertkit anywhere in his application via a React Context and a custom React Hook.

This approach is inspired by [the fundamentals that Brennan Dunn teaches in his amazing Mastering Converkit workshop](https://createandsell.co/courses/mastering-convertkit?ref=joelhooks) which I highly recommend.
