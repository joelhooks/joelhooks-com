Recording a podcast is a shitload of work. I'm not gonna try to polish that aspect of it and make it seem like it is anything but work. It's particularly difficult if you want to maintain it as a practice over time. That's true for most difficult things that are totally worth it.

For me, podcasting is totally worth it.

I'm really proud of myself and the work, care, and consistent effort that has gone into publishing [the egghead podcast](https://egghead.io/podcast).

The original idea was a technical podcast that we could use to chat with eggheqd instructors about their work and upcoming materials as a sort of promotion.

It quickly evolved beyond that for me into something more interesting. A way to connect with smart people doing interesting things and learn about them at a more human level. The podcast isn't very technical, though everybody that I interview is very technically capable and is in the field of software development.

I'd love to know what you think.
