Twitter has been my online home since 2008. I've written ~50,000 tweets, chronicled the progression through multiple careers, made countless friends, and leveraged the network to build a business that has generated well over $30,000,000 in revenue.

To say Twitter has been an important part of my life as a web developer and citizen of the internet would be a massive understatement.

It's my local pub, my water cooler, and provides me with a lot of joy interacting with my friends and collegues.

But...

If there's one thing you can count on, it's that digital tools you love can and do change. They change in ways that don't align with your worldview.

In tech (and beyond), often all it takes is **one asshole** to wreck something you've used and loved.
